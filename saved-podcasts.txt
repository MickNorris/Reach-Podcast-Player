Confidant. Traitor. Sister. All of those words describe Morgan Le Fay, King Arthur's half-sister.

If you're familiar with the legends, you're going to see a Morgan you've never seen before. If you're not, get ready to meet one of the most interesting, tragic figures you'll come across.

It is quite possibly the oldest epic we have, and though it only exists in fragments, it tells a surprisingly human story. There are questions of life and death, such as what it all means and why are we here? It delves into the issues of what it means to be a human rather than just a beast, what it means to be a good ruler, and what it means to leave a legacy. These are questions relevant even today, over 4,000 years after this story was told. Of course, it is also folklore, so there is a troubling amount of hairy nudity. All-in-all, this three-parter will be epic. For the creature of the week, we'll meet a creepy forest dweller with an unexpected hobby.

Things have been pretty easy for Jason. Medea solved all of his problems before he even knew he had them on the Argo, and her fairly violent murder-by-proxy of Pelias secured Iolcus for Jason's father. It would probably be a very bad idea to cheat on Medea, right? Hard times are about to catch up with Jason.

There is a dragon, a giant bronze robot, and court intrigue, leading to some familiar names coming back to help Jason travel to a faraway land and obtain the golden fleece. Those names include Hercules, Theseus, Laertes (father of Odysseus), Autolycus, Peleus (the father of Achilles), Augeus (with the legendarily dirty stables), and more. It's the biggest meetup of everyone we've met so far...well, everyone that isn't in Hades (Sisyphus) tied to a rock (Prometheus) or wandering blind through a plain (Bellerophon). The creature looks so much like a normal person it's uncanny. I mean, he looks like a normal person once you get past his humorously big ears, nose, and hands. And his gray skin...that sometimes glows. Ok, he looks nothing like a normal person.

He's a trickster we've met before, but he has an entire episode of semi-murderous turtle hijinks. Even though turtles are cute and seemingly harmless, they should not be trusted under any circumstances ever. You should also avoid going into business with them, when possible.
